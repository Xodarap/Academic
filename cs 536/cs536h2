1.
1.1 ([^*]|[^/]) is ., since everything is either not a * or not a /. 
	Bad comment: /* */ foo */ 
1.2 It shouldn't be able to end with multiple slashes.
	Bad comment: /* *////
1.3 Since the * is greedy, it will eat up stuff which it shouldn't
	Bad comment: /* cmt */ x = 1; /* cmt 2 */
1.4 It's ok to have stars and slashes inside a comment
	Good comment: /* ** */
1.5 It doesn't count stuff without stars
	Good comment: /* test */

2. {SLASH}{STAR}.*?{STAR}{SLASH}
This is 1.3, but it avoids the greediness since ? is lazy.
