Ben West's Multiplication Algorithm

Takes two lines of data from std in, each representing a number.
Returns one line indicating the product of the two numbers, and another indicating the number of additions and multiplications done

Sample:
ben@ben-1000 ~/S/g/A/c/p1> ./multiplication 
99
99
9801
(32,32)


I input 99*99 here, and it gave me the result of 9801. It did 32 adds (first number) and 32 multiplications (second number) in the process.
