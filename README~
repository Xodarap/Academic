This repository contains modifications to the mapper utility developed by the TMSCSCS group at stanford. See http://comptop.stanford.edu/programs/.

See mapperSample.m for a sample implementation. Mapper relies on graphviz for the graph visualization; you will need that also.

Changes:

	findCentroids - created. Finds the centroid of each node
	writeDotFile -
		* Use lighter or darker text, depending on the node's color
		* Allow labeling of centroids
		* Allow labeling based on filter value
